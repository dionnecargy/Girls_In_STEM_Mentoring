## How can we use our lab data? {.center}

. . . 

Using the results of our experiments, or from other sources, we obtain [data]{.purple-emph}! 

. . . 

We use many different [languages]{.purple-emph} to communicate what we would like to see from our data.

. . . 

These are called [coding languages]{.purple-emph} or simply [coding]{.purple-emph}.

## What is [coding]{.purple-emph} and what is [R]{.purple-emph} ?

. . .

[Coding]{.purple} involves writing instructions that a machine or computer can understand to perform a task.

. . .

[R]{.purple} is coding language used in statistics, data science and many other disciplines. It is also very powerful tool for visualising data.

. . .

## Why should you [learn R]{.purple} ? {.center}

. . .

‚öñÔ∏è R is free, open source and everyone can access

. . .

\
ü•≥ It can do so many things

. . .

\
üìö Lots of resources to learn and perform tasks, with a very large user community

. . .

\
üßë‚Äçüéì You can get a super cool job ! It's a fantastic skill that is highly sought after in the work force.

# Example 1: Using Raw Luminex Data to Detect Infection 

## What are antigens and antibodies?

\
[Antigens]{.purple-emph} are foreign substances, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and toxins. 

. . . 

[Antibodies]{.purple-emph} are protective proteins produced by your immune system. They attach to [antigens]{.purple-emph} and remove them from your body. 

. . . 

Immunologists use machines like the [MAGPIX]{.purple-emph} to test antibody responses to multiple antigens in a blood sample!

## My work at WEHI

Because I like [coding]{.purple-emph}, I was tasked with making a website application to convert the raw data into a format that can be used to predict whether a person has a malaria infection or not! 

. . . 

{{< video images/1_inputtingdata_short.mp4 >}}

:::{.notes}
This involved: 

- A dataset that looks like this: 

- Cleaning it up to look like this:

- Then applying a machine learning algorithm so it can produce a result like this:

# Example 2: An Infectious Disease Outbreak 

## What are infectious diseases?

\
ü¶† Infectious diseases are caused by certain microorganisms, such as [bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi]{.purple-emph}, and will make people (or animals) sick when they are exposed to these microorganisms.

. . .

üí≠ Most microorganisms don't make us sick, but some do, and these are known as [pathogens]{.purple-emph}.

. . .

ü§ß There are lots of different ways that you might get an infectious disease. Some ways include breathing [respiratory droplets]{.purple}, eating [contaminated food or water]{.purple}, insect [bites]{.purple} and many many more !

## When do infectious diseases cause outbreaks?

üìöThe [World Health Organisation]{.purple} definition of an [outbreak]{.purple}:

. . .

üí° ["occurence of disease in excess of normal"]{.purple.emph}

. . .

This might be because of a new pathogen, bringing pathogens to new areas, a mutating pathogen.

. . .

\
Many infectious diseases now have vaccines that mean outbreaks to these pathogens occur much less frequently (for example: measles, chicken pox, influenza etc.)

## How can we [analyse]{.purple} outbreaks?

# The situation

## The [excursion]{.purple}

Unknown illness causes students to [fall ill]{.purple} at local school.

*Local authorities are unsure of the cause of this outbreak, but it appears to be linked to a recent excursion to Melbourne CBD*

A few days earlier, students at a local school went into Melbourne to see an exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria.

. . .

\
üöå At 8am, they took the bus to the NGV.

. . .

üé® They were in the gallery from 9am - 12pm.

. . .

üç≤ They had lunch from 12pm - 2pm at three different locations

. . .

üßë‚Äçüé® They went back to the gallery for another exhibition between 2 -4 pm

. . .

üè° At 4pm they were back on the bus to go home

## You have been given some information in a [dataset]{.purple}

. . . 

Including: 

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Name

-   Class

-   Age

-   Sex
:::

-   Height

-   Weight

-   Was the student feeling sick

-   What were their symptoms

. . .

```{r data entry}
#| include: false
#| echo: false

source(here::here("presentation/setup.R"))
```

```{r kable_outbreak_data}
#| echo: false
kable(head(outbreak_data))
```
. . . 

[And we can then ask questions with these data in R !]{.purple-emph}

## Data Visualisation: Our gateway to interpreting our data

. . . 

An important variable to look at when it comes to [disease]{.purple} would be [temperature]{.purple}. 

. . . 

We can use a dot or point graph to identify the temperature ([y-axis]{.purple}) of each individual in our class ([x-axis]{.purple}). 

. . . 

```{r scatter1, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: fragment

ggplot(data = outbreak_data, 
       aes(x = class, y = temperature)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## A boxplot summarising [temperature]{.purple} in the four [classes]{.purple}

. . . 

```{r boxplot_temp, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: fragment

ggplot(data = outbreak_data, 
       aes(x = class, y = temperature)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```


## A boxplot summarising [temperature]{.purple} in the four [classes]{.purple}

```{r boxplot_temp_sick, fig.align='center'}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: fragment

  ggplot(data = outbreak_data,
         aes(x = class, y = temperature, fill = sickness))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

. . .

[What does temperature tell us about how the students were feeling?]{.purple-emph}

::: {.notes}
-   Were the temperatures the same for students who were sick and those who weren't

-   Where the sick students in all classes

-   Why do people get a temperature when they get sick?
:::

## Let's focus on the student's symptoms {.purple}

. . . 

There were 11 students that were sick, and 18 that were not sick. 

. . . 

But what is making the students sick ?

## What symptoms do the sick students have ?

```{r bar_sick, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: fragment

symptoms_sick <- symptoms %>% filter(sickness=="yes")
ggplot(data = symptoms_sick,
       aes(y = symptom, fill = status))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title = "What symptoms do the sick students have ?")
```

What does this graph tell us?

-   What are the symptoms of those that are sick?

-   What might be some causes of illness that give these symptoms?

. . . 

Likely cause...

# Salmonella 

## What is [salmonella](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/index.html)?

-   A bacterial infection

-   Commonly from contaminated food

-   Examples...undercooked chicken, raw egg, insufficient cleaning

-   You can start to feel sick within 6 to 36 hours after eating

# But how did the students get sick ?

## Where did the students get sick?

üé® At the gallery?

. . .

üöå On the bus?

. . .

üç≤ At lunch?

## WAIT ! We have some more information

üç≤ We have just been sent some information about where the student's ate lunch !

. . .

They ate at three different restaurants !

```{r map_data}
source(here::here("presentation/map.R"))
```

## Using R, we can plot where the students ate their lunch...

```{r plot_melb_map}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: fragment
#| 
ggmap(melb_map)+
   geom_point(data=map_data, aes(x =long, y = lat, colour = sickness), size = 12, shape = 1,)
```

## This was based on a real life outbreak in Melbourne !
